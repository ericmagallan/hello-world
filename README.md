# hello-world
Free code camp repository
This is the first time I've written code outside of a classroom.
I pray that my hardwork takes me to work at NASA-JPL in Pasadena CA, 
become an entrepreneur in tech with my wife and open a gorgeous wedding/event venue
with my wife. Also, help people in under-represented communities attain their dreams
and be able to provide for their communities and families.
